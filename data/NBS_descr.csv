edicitnet_code;NBS;DESCRIPTION;OTHER NAMES
1;Infiltration basin;This NBS is a shallow impound area with highly permeable soils designed to temporarily detain and infiltrate stormwater runoff. It collects and stores runoff, allowing it to infiltrate into the ground (allowing pollutants to settle and filter out). The water fills up the depression and then soaks into the ground or is discharged to a conveyance system or a receiving waterbody (in the latter case, the term detention pond can be used). This NBS does not retain a permanent pool of water. Adapted from URBANGREENUP (2018) (2018), UNALAB (2019) (2019), Woods-Ballard et al. (2015) and University of Arkansas Community Design Center (2010).;"(Dry) Detention Pond; Floodable park; Wadi; Non-permanent infiltration basin; Green water storage and infiltration system; Storm basin; Micro-catchment; The sponge zone."
2;(Wet) Retention Pond;This NBS consists of a constructed stormwater pond that retains a permanent pool of water and thus, provides additional storage capacity during rainfall events. It has the capacity to retain stormwater continuously, remove urban pollutants and release the effluent at a controlled rate. During dry periods it also holds water. Adapted from URBANGREENUP (2018), UNALAB (2019) and University of Arkansas Community Design Center (2010).;"Water Retention ponds; Green retention pond; Extended Retention Basin; Holding pond; Pond; Waste stabilization ponds with Bunds"
3;Rain garden;It is a planted depression designed to collect, store, infiltrate and filter stormwater runoff on a small-scale, especially in urban areas. It combines layers of organic sandy soil for infiltration and mulch to promote microbial activity. Native plants are recommended based upon their intrinsic synergies with local climate, soil, and moisture conditions without the use of fertilizers and chemicals. Storm water runoff is drained, stored for a certain period, and then infiltrates into the ground soil. This NBS can have an above-ground overflow for excess water, although in some instances a simple underdrain may be more effective than providing a small control structure or overflows.

(2015);"Infiltration garden; Rainfall garden; Water control garden, Floodable garden, Bio retention filter, Bio retention area, Bioremediation wet retention"
4;Swale;This NBS is an open lined or unlined, gently sloped, vegetated channel designed for treatment and conveyance of stormwater runoff. The main function of a Swale is to treat stormwater runoff as it is conveyed, whereas the main function of a rain garden is to treat stormwater runoff as it is infiltrated. Bioswales require curb cuts, gutters or other devices that direct flow towards them. This NBS is often used to drain roads, paths or car parks while enhancing access corridors or other open spaces. Adapted from URBANGREENUP (2018), NATURE4CITIES (2020), UNALAB (2019), Woods Ballard et al 2015 and University of Arkansas Community Design Center (2010);"Grassed swale, Swale, Bioswale; Green drainage corridor; Vegetative filter; Vegetated swale"
5;Constructed wetland;"This NBS includes a range of engineered systems designed and constructed to replicate natural processes occurring in natural wetlands involving vegetation, soils, and the associated microbial assemblages to assist in treating wastewater streams (e.g., domestic, industrial) and stormwater. The treated water can be reused for safe aquifer recharge or for other non-potable reuses such as irrigation and toilet flushing. This NBS can be divided in two main hydrological categories: Free water surface wetlands, a shallow sealed basin or sequence of basins (open water areas) containing floating plants, submerged plants or emergent plants (similar in appearance to natural marshes); Subsurface flow wetlands, which include Horizontal flow (HF) wetlands and Vertical flow (VF) wetlands. In this case, the water flows beneath the surface level, either horizontally or vertically, through the filter bed.

6;Green facade;This NBS is based on the application of climbing plants along the wall (in building facade or other types of walls).  The wall is completely or partially covered with greenery and the plants can grow upwards. The climber plants are planted in the ground (soil) or in containers (filled with soil or substrate) and grow directly on the wall (direct systems), or climb using climbing-aids (indirect systems) that are attached to the wall.

7;Green wall system;This NBS is a greening vertical panel that is fixed onto walls (in building facade or other types of walls). The panels allow the placement of plants and substrate on the entire surface. In contrast to green façades, this NBS can support a wider variety of plant species (e.g. shrubs, grasses and several perennials). The panels can be continuous or modular. Continuous panels are lightweight and permeable screens in which plants are inserted individually. A frame is fixed to the wall to support the panel, normally leaving a gap between the system and the surface. Modular panels can have several elements with specific dimension (e.g.trays, vessels, planter tiles flexible bags), which include the growing media where plants can grow. These elements together can create modular sections that are supported by a complementary structure or fixed directly on the vertical surface. Some systems allow the removal of panels during wintertime.

10;Vegetated pergola;This NBS uses pillars, beams, stretched textile structure and lattices in different materials and compositions to create a growing assistance for vegetation and provide shaded areas. On this structure an inert substrate can be installed, to be covered with seeds. This NBS can be fixed to the facades of the buildings, on the street or by posts fixed to the sidewalk.

11;Extensive green roof;This NBS involves basic, lightweight, planted systems that are implemented on the rooftop of building and are usually not accessible by the public.  The most common plants used are sedum, herbs, mosses, and grasses. The installation and maintenance are less expensive than that of intensive systems. The growth medium is relatively thinner (8-15 cm) than for intensive systems (more than 20 cm). Adapted from URBANGREENUP (2018), UNALAB (2019), NATURE4CITIES (2020), Somarakis et al. (2019) and  FFL  (2002);"Green roof; Constructed wet roof; Green covering shelters; living roof"
12;Intensive green roof;This NBS consists of implementing a great diversity of vegetation (higher variety than extensive GR) on rooftops. These spaces are normally accessible to the public for recreation, gardening, relaxation and socializing purposes. This NBS is usually heavier and has a deeper substrate (more than 20 cm) as compared to extensive systems. In addition, it requires higher installation and maintenance efforts such as regular irrigation and fertilisation but provides more biotopes and higher biodiversity.

13;Semi-intensive green roof;This NBS is implemented on rooftops as a combination of areas of intensive and extensive green roofs. This NBS can support a great variety of plants such as small herbaceous plants, ground covers, grasses, perennials and small shrubs, as well as higher growing plants). Plants with lower water and fertilizer demand are prioritized, requiring moderate maintenance (more than extensive and less than intensive systems).

14;Create and preserve habitats and shelters for biodiversity;"This NBS replicates habitats for biodiversity and thus is designed to attract, shelter or provide food to a specific type of organism and animals or animal. It may involve creating or preserving existing site(s) or individual or grouped elements. Some examples of this NBS are: dead wood; standing dead trees; pollinator areas or modules; spot planted with vegetation of different age, size, type and features; trees displaying hollows or cavities; artificial shelters.

15;Street trees;This NBS is focused on planting, renewing or maintaining urban street trees. It is designed to be appropriate for its context (right tree in the right place) and to achieve multiple benefits. One single or several trees can be arranged along streets, bicycle paths and sidewalks. These trees are situated on a single side (e.g. single line trees) and if circumstances allow, they can be established on both sides of the route (e.g.boulevard). In the latter case, the treetops of opposite trees often form a (nearly) closed canopy.
