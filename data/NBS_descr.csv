5;Constructed wetland;"This NBS are engineered systems designed and constructed to replicate natural processes occurring in natural wetlands involving vegetation, soils, and the associated microbial assemblages to assist in treating wastewaters (i.e, domestic, industrial) and stormwater. The treated water can be reused for safe aquifer recharge or other further non-potable reuses such as irrigation and toilet flush. This NBS can be divided in two main hydrology categories: Free water surface wetlands, a shallow sealed basin or sequence of basins (open water areas) containing floating plants, submerged plants or emergent plants (similar in appearance to natural marshes); Subsurface flow wetlands which includes Horizontal subsurface flow wetland and Vertical flow (VF) wetlands. In this case, the water flows on the subsurface, either horizontally or vertically, through the filter bed.

14;Create and preserve habitats and shelters for biodiversity;"This NBS replicates habitats for biodiversity and thus is designed to attract, shelter or provide food to a specific type of organism (for example ladybirds, bumblebees, swifts, robins), or animal (for example ground insects, bats). It may consist in creating or preserving existing site(s) or individual or grouped elements. Some examples of this NBS are: dead wood; standing dead trees; pollinator areas or modules; spot planted with vegetation of different age, size, type and features; trees displaying hollows or cavities; artificial shelters (adapted from UrbanGreenUp and Nature4Cities).";"Biodiversity micro habitats; Biodiversity facilitating structures; shelter for biodiversity;  Shelters for insects /shelters for animals bird modules/insect modules; Habitat elements; Habitat replicate; Habitat features; Habitat enhancement; Habitat structures; Habitat and shelter modules; Artificial shelters ('tree hollows', 'pollinator planting', 'understorey planting'); BioDiv device."
31;Diverting and deflecting elements;This NBS employs elements such as rocks, larger tree trunks, willow branches that are placed near the riverbank or in the middle of a river. This NBS alters flow variation and sediment shifting processes affecting the development of the channel's length and depth. In this sense, the main objective is to redirect, disturb, divert and deflect the water flow and initiate water dynamics for riverside protection against erosion.

11;Extensive green roof;This NBS implies basic, lightweight, planted systems that are implemented on the rooftop of building and usually does not have a public access.  The most common plants used are sedum, herbs, mosses, and grasses. The installation and maintenance are less expensive than that of intensive systems. The growth medium is relatively thinner (8-15 cm) than for intensive systems (more than 20 cm) (adapted from UrbanGreenUp, Unalab, Nature4Cities and ThinkNature (FFL, 2018);"Green roof; Constructed wet roof; Green covering shelters; living roof"
16;Green Corridors;This NBS aims to renature areas of derelict infrastructure such railway lines or along waterways and rivers, transforming them into linear parks. This NBS can be considered transition areas between biomes that connect neighbourhoods. This NBS can play an important role in urban green infrastructure networks (adapted from Nature4Cities and ThinkNature).;"Green belts; Green way"
6;Green facade;This NBS is based on the application of climbing plants along the wall (in building façade or other types of walls).  The wall is completely or partially covered with greenery where the plants can grow upwards. The climber plants are planted in the ground (soil) or in containers (filled with soil or substrate) and grow directly on the wall (direct systems), or climb using climbing-aids (Indirect systems) that is connected to the wall. These NBS can also be implemented along highly frequented roads to reduce noise emissions (adapted from UrbanGreenUp, Unalab, Nature4Cities, (Manso and Castro-Gomes, 2015) and Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008).;"Green façade with climbing plants; climber green wall; Ground-based green-wall; Green climber wall; Green wall with ground-based greening; Climber plant wall; Ground-Based Green Facade with Climbing Plants;"
7;Green wall system;This NBS is a greening vertical panel that is fixed onto façades. The panels allow the placement of plants and substrate on the entire surface. In contrast to green façades, this NBS can support a wider variety of plant species (i.e shrubs, grasses and several perennials). The panels can be continuous or modular. Continuous panels are lightweight and permeable screens in which plants are inserted individually. A frame is fixed to the wall to support the panel, normally leaving a gap between the system and the surface. Modular panels can have several elements with specific dimension (i.e. trays, vessels, planter tiles flexible bags), which include the growing media where plants can grow. These elements together can create modular sections that are supported by a complementary structure or fixed directly on the vertical surface. Some systems allow the removal of panels during winter time (adapted from UrbanGreenUp, Unalab and Nature4Cities, (Manso and Castro-Gomes, 2015)).;"Hydroponic green façade; Façade-bound greening; Façade bound green wall; living wall; Continuous green wall; Plant wall system; Green façade with vertical panels; Greening vertical panel; Vertical greening panel"

1;Infiltration basin;This NBS is a are shallow impound areas with highly permeable soils designed to temporarily detain and infiltrate stormwater runoff. It collects and store runoff allowing it to infiltrate into the ground (allowing pollutants to settle and filter out). The water fills up the depression and then soaks into the ground or discharged to a conveyance system or a receiving waterbody (in this latest case they can also be called as detention pond). This NBS do not retain a permanent pool of water (adapted from UrbanGreenup, Unalab and Woods Ballard et al 2015) (University of Arkansas community design center, 2010);"(Dry) Detention Pond; Floodable park; Wadi; Non-permanent infiltration basin; Green water storage and infiltration system; Storm basin; Micro-catchment; The sponge zone."
12;Intensive green roof;This NBS consists of implementing a great diversity of vegetation (higher variety than extensive GR) on rooftops.

3;Rain garden;It is a a planted depression designed to collect, store, infiltrate and filter stormwater runoff on a small-scale especially in urban areas. It combines layers of organic sandy soil for infiltration, and mulch to promote microbial activity. Native plants are recommended based upon their intrinsic synergies with local climate, soil, and moisture conditions without the use of fertilizers and chemicals. Storm water runoff is drained, stored for a certain period, and then it infiltrates either into the ground soil. They can have an above-ground overflow where excess water exits, although in some instances a simple underdrain may be more effective than providing a small control structure or overflows.
